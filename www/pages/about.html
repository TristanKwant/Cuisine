  <h1>About us</h1>
  <p>Cuisine cookbooks had modest beginnings when Fred Carlson opened a small local print shop in 1933. His son-in-law, Harold Morris, took over the business in 1956 and the family tradition continued when Harold's son, Scott, became president in 1976. Today, Scott's son, Ryan, works with his father in the family business.
