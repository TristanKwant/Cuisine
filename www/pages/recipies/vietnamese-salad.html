title: Vietnamese Banana Blossom Salad

descr: We of course realize that most of you probably donâ€™t have banana blossoms growing in your backyard (we actually have it right now!), but you can easily replace it with any kind of cabbage, and you will still have a fresh, spicy and very asian inspired salad. We have made a few adjustments from the original recipe. We have added papaya or green mango, which is very common in asian salads, and used agave instead of sugar in the marinade.

step1: Place the layers of the banana blossom (or the cabbage leaves) on top of each other and roll them tight together.

step2:  Slice them very thin and place them in a bowl of ice water and lime for about 20 minutes, then squeeze until dry and set aside.

step3: Make the marinade, add all the ingredients in a small bowl and stir around until dissolved.

step4: Combine banana blossom, papaya, onion, carrot, green pepper, coriander, marinade and peanuts in a large bowl and toss until well blended.

step5: Arrange the salad on a serving platter (or as we did, on a thick part of the banana or cabbage leaf) and sprinkle with shallots, peanuts and if you are up for it some extra red chili.

step6: Serve and enjoy this spicy classic vietnamese dish!
